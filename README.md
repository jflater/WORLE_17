# Rainfall simulation performed at WORLE research farm near Ames, IA.   

Next steps:     
	1. Identify journal that we will target for two papers (WORLE, Armstrong).
	2. Identify soil samples for fungal DNA extraction, up to 700 samples may be sequenced.
	3. Identify manure associated bacteria, fungi and ARGs and track them through the course of the experiment.
